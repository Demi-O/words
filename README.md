# words

Simple chrome extension that uses the Oxford Dictionary API to quickly get information on a specifed word. Information could be the meaning of the word, its synonyms, how it's used in a sentence etc

I made this because I usually open up a new tab to search when I come across a word I am not familiar with or whose meaning I can't remember, this extension is meant to quicken that process.
